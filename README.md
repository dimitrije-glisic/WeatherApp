## Environment Setup

This project uses environment files to manage API keys and other configuration settings. The actual environment files (`environment.ts`) are not included in the repository for security reasons.

To set up your environment files:

1. Navigate to the `src/environments` directory.
2. Copy `environment_example.ts` to `environment.ts` for the development environment.
3. Open the copied files and replace the placeholder values with your actual API URL and API key.

Example:
```sh
cp src/environments/environment_example.ts src/environments/environment.ts
